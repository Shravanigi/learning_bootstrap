        <p>To ensure we can craft your delicious treats to perfection, we recommend placing orders with sufficient lead time. For items from our popular Signature Cake Collection, as well as most cupcakes and individual desserts, a minimum of 24 to 48 hours' notice is generally ideal. This allows us to source the freshest ingredients and allocate baking and decorating time efficiently. However, for bespoke Custom Cake Orders, especially those requiring intricate designs, multiple tiers, or specific dietary accommodations, we kindly request a minimum of 7 to 10 days' advance notice. This extended lead time is crucial for detailed consultations, ingredient procurement, and dedicating the necessary artisan hours to bring your unique vision to life flawlessly.

          At Bake Delights, we are committed to providing delicious options for a wide range of dietary needs and restrictions. We offer specially crafted versions of our cakes and desserts that can be prepared as vegan, gluten-free, or nut-free upon your specific request. Our team follows strict protocols to prevent cross-contamination during preparation, using dedicated equipment and work surfaces where possible. However, it is important to note that our kitchen handles common allergens such as wheat, dairy, eggs, and nuts. Therefore, while we take every precaution, individuals with severe, life-threatening allergies should exercise caution. We urge you to communicate all dietary needs and allergies clearly and in detail when placing your order so we can advise you on the best possible options.

          Proper storage is key to maintaining the freshness, flavor, and integrity of your Bake Delights cake. For most of our cakes featuring classic buttercreams or tangy cream cheese frostings, refrigeration is recommended to preserve their quality and structural stability. To ensure the best possible flavor and moist texture, we advise bringing these cakes to room temperature for approximately 30 to 60 minutes before serving. Cakes adorned with fondant, however, should typically be stored at room temperature in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight or excessive heat, as refrigeration can sometimes cause condensation. Always store your cake in an airtight container or its original box to prevent it from drying out or absorbing other odors from your refrigerator.

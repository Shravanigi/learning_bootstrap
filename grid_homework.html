                    <p> Introduction: The idea behind this project comes from the increasing number of people who live away from home, such as bachelors, students, and working professionals. These individuals often crave the comfort and taste of home-cooked meals but lack the time or ability to cook for themselves. This project aims to provide them with an easy and affordable way to enjoy homemade food, solving a common problem in their daily routine. Many people who live away from home do not have access to homemade food and instead rely on fast food or restaurant meals, which can be unhealthy and costly in the long term. Existing food delivery services focus mainly on restaurant-prepared food and rarely offer the wholesome, comforting nature of homemade meals. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a dedicated service for delivering homemade dishes to customers in need of a healthier, homier option.</p>
